twitter-bootstrap-starter-kit
=============================

Starter Kit that combines the best-in-class frameworks into repo

## Getting Started

Starter Kit includes:

+ [Bootstrap 3.0.0 RC2](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)
+ [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
+ [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Open+Sans) // free font hosted by Google
+ [less.js](http://lesscss.org/) // for development purposes

Disabled-by-default-but-it's-there-for-ya:

+ [jquery.js](http://jquery.com/)
+ [Kirby Tookit (PHP)](http://toolkit.getkirby.com/)

This also includes a base index.php file along with its own _header.php and _footer.php.
Controls are provided to easily flip between development (using .less) and production modes (using .css).

## Modifying Files

The assets folder is primarily separated by frameworks. Thus, whenever there's an update (to Twitter Bootstrap or Font Awesome), you can just swap out the entire directories without worrying about cross-dependencies.
